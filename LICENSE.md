#### AI and Authorship Statement

All creative decisions, structural choices, and final expressions in this work are the result of **human authorship** and are protected under U.S. and international **copyright law**.

AI tools were used as assistive instruments under the explicit **direction** and **control** of the author. Their role was limited to **iterative phrasing** and **pattern shaping** within a **human-driven creative process**.

All outputs from AI tools were treated as **raw material**, reshaped through human **intention**, critical **judgment**, and **authorship**. This book emerged through a live, symbolic interaction between human and Machine — one shaped entirely under human authorship, intent, and care.

The machine offered rhythm.  

**I held the Field.  
No one else could.**
